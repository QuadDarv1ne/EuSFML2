# About:

EuSFML2 is a wrapper of SFML2 for the Euphoria programming languages. All major and minor functions
have been wrapped. As SFML2 is written in modules for graphics, audio, windows and so on, the
Euphoria wrapper also has been written in a module way. EuGfx2.ew for graphics functions, EuSys2.ew
for system functions. You can include each one as you need them. You will need a good understanding
of the SFML2 and Euphoria programming language to use this wrapper efficiently. Note that this is
wrapper of the C binding of SFML2. To learn how to use this library, you can go over the examples
included with this software.
